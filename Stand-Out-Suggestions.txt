1.Specify reasonable Memory and CPU allocation in the Kubernetes deployment configuration
I can set resource requests and limits in the containers section of my Deployment YAML to help
Kubernetes scheduler allocate appropriate resources for each Pod.

2.In your README, specify what AWS instance type would be best used for the application? Why?

- Recommended AWS Instance Type: t3.medium
- This instance type provides a good balance of CPU and memory resources, suitable for running the Coworking application.
- Adjust the instance type based on your specific workload and performance requirements.

3.In your README, provide your thoughts on how we can save on cost

Cost-Saving Tips:
- Consider leveraging AWS Reserved Instances for predictable workloads.
- Utilize AWS Spot Instances for non-critical tasks to take advantage of cost savings.
- Implement auto-scaling policies to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
- Regularly monitor and optimize storage usage to control costs efficiently.
